            <p><strong><span class="brand-text">DARING ESCAPES</span></strong> are team building activities that create scenarios where participants must rely on each other, their ability to communicate and their creative genius to escape a room. Our productions allow people to get a taste of what it would be like to be on reality TV shows such as <em><strong>Fear Factor</strong></em>, <em><strong>Minute To Win It</strong></em>, <em><strong>Survivor</strong></em> &amp; <em><strong>The Amazing Race</strong></em><strong> </strong>while implementing their leadership, communication and problem solving skills that are used in the everyday work place. Participants must use their wit, sleuthing skills, team work and sheer determination to find clues, solve puzzles and unlock a door within 60 minutes to escape a locked room.</p>
            <p>Participants get to become part of a plot and a cohesive unit that actively controls the story line of their session. Gone are the days when we only had the option to just go to a movie and watch the action unfold. With Daring Escapes, you get some skin in the game as you and your friends and co-workers become the protagonists who race against the clock to determine your own fate.</p>
            <p>When you attempt a Daring Escape, for 60 minutes of your life you will become totally removed from your current world and are focused on nothing but escape. The circumstances that are created bring about excitement, laughter and ample amounts of adrenaline and force you to manage yourself efficiently and effectively with others thus creating a amazing team building experience. Whether you escape or not, at the end of the day, you will have created a memory and will have learned communication lessons that will be etched into your mind for eternity.</p>
            <p>At the end of every session, our staff analyzes each participant&#8217;s ability to problem solve, communicate effectively under pressure and demonstrate the spirit of a cohesive unit. Prepare for one of the most high value team building experiences you have ever done!</p>
