            <h1 class="text-center">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

            <h3 class="brand-text"><strong>What happens if the Zombie touches me?</strong></h3>
            <p>Don't get touched by the crawling Zombie! If you get touched by the crawling zombie, you will be required to sit and no longer will be permitted to search for clues, but you can still participate verbally. The Zombie is chained to a wall and may not roam freely, but the chain is released another foot every five minutes so you better be quick at putting together the clues, solving the riddles and finding the key that will set you free, otherwise you will be Zombie bait.</p>

            <h3 class="brand-text"><strong>How many participants are in the session?</strong></h3>
            <p>The script is written to allow up to 12 people in a session at once. You may be in a session with other people you do not know. The entire group is on the same team working together to escape and not get eaten.</p>

            <h3 class="brand-text"><strong>How long will it take?</strong></h3>
            <p>This depends on how much smarter you are than a Zombie! If you do not find all the clues and solve the puzzles that unlock the door within 60 minutes, you will be eaten by a Zombie and we will have to remove your body from the room. Allow one and half hours for the entire session for instruction time, a solution explanation and an analysis of your team building traits.</p>

            <h3 class="brand-text"><strong>Will I really get eaten if I don't escape?</strong></h3>
            <p>Cannibalism has been outlawed since 1804, so the Zombie is not legally permitted to eat you. </p>

            <h3 class="brand-text"><strong>What should I bring with me?</strong></h3>
            <p>Your inner Sherlock Holmes and all the sleuthing skills you can muster! The answers to the clues, riddles and puzzles are all in the room. You will be using your ability to look for clues, figure out logic, communicate with the other performers and apply deductive reasoning to escape. Don't give up! Keep searching for clues. You are going to have to work fast!</p>

            <h3 class="brand-text"><strong>Are cell phones permitted?</strong></h3>
            <p>Cell phones are not allowed to be used in the room. The use of electronic devices or any outside tools are strictly prohibited and you will immediately be removed from the show if you attempt to use them.</p>

            <h3 class="brand-text"><strong>What happens if I arrive late?</strong></h3>
            <p>The door to the room closes exactly at the time you signed up for. Please arrive 15 - 20 minutes early to make sure you are there before the room is locked. You will not be permitted into the room if you are late. THERE ARE NO REFUNDS.</p>

            <h3 class="brand-text"><strong>How old do you have to be?</strong></h3>
            <p>We do not recommend this show for children under the age of 8. Appetizers...er, guests ages 8-14 must be accompanied by a paying adult in the room (1 adult : 6 kids). A minimum of two adults must accompany and stay on site with groups of children (including birthday parties) under the age of 18. Infants and toddlers will not be allowed in the room; zombies do not like baby food.</p>

            <h3 class="brand-text"><strong>What if I am pregnant?</strong></h3>
            <p>We do not recommend this show for women who are pregnant.</p>

            <h3 class="brand-text"><strong>What if I am epileptic?</strong></h3>
            <p>There are no strobe/flashing lights used in the show; however there is a buzzer (similar to a school bell) that rings every 5 minutes and other loud noises that occur over the course of the adrenaline-packed, hour-long show.</p>

            <h3 class="brand-text"><strong>Can I schedule a private show for just our group?</strong></h3>
            <p>To reserve an entire session for your group, you need to purchase all 12 tickets at once. Please contact us if there are no session times available with 12 tickets and we will create a special session time for you.</p>

            <h3 class="brand-text"><strong>Are you hiring?</strong></h3>
            <p>We are always looking for hungry zombies and perky PVGs! If you are interested in acting for us, please submit your resume, headshot, and a brief statement of interest to the <strong><a class="brand-text" href="mailto:info@daringroomescapes.com">email address</a></strong>.</p>
